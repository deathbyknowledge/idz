This is the first sample document for testing the IDZ CLI tool.
It contains multiple lines of text that will be chunked and embedded.
Each line represents a potential chunk in the vector database.
The embedding model will process these chunks for similarity search.
Vector databases are useful for semantic search applications.
They allow finding similar content based on meaning rather than exact matches.
